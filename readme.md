> [!NOTE]
> Injection flags programs as malicious because it forces unauthorized access to inject code. Antivirus software detects these exploits as false positives since they involve injecting code into running processes. Using a DLL to inject into the games process triggers the antivirus. This behavior is called a false positive.

### Internal Features 
</div>

**Change "clicked" values**
- You can change the clicked numbers to any you want, take note that 4,294,967,296 clicks will most of the time crash your game due to the 32-bit integer limit, this cannot be fixed, but I had implemented a safety function that blocks requests over 4,000,000,000

**Farm Drops**
- This feature has a function that sends a request to click a banana every 1.5 minutes, the reason for that is that the game checks if you click on the banana every 3 minutes, for safety, I made it 1.5 minutes, in case the request doesn't send.

**Equip any Banana**
- Not really useful, but you can troll your friends that you got a rare banana! Since I did not make a premade list of the IDs, you will have to enter it manually by just pasting the marketplace link of the banana

**Notify on Drop**
- Why not? Still good to have, but the prices might be incorrect sometimes
